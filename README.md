## Learn about IT Infrastructure Components

To excel in a DevOps environment, it is essential to grasp the fundamental components of an organization's infrastructure, whether it resides in a cloud or an on-premise data center. Acquiring this knowledge enables effective collaboration and communication, especially when engaging with network and security teams.

Having a solid understanding of infrastructure empowers you to ask relevant questions, comprehend their responses, and enhance collaboration. Instead of simply stating, "It's not working, can you fix it?" you can contribute more effectively by saying, "I've conducted initial troubleshooting and identified some findings. Could you investigate further and help us determine the root cause of the issue?"
