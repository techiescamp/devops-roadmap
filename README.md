## üîÑ Understand DevOps Philosophy

To become a DevOps engineer, the first and most important thing is to understand the DevOps Philosophy. It's all about different teams working together towards a common goal. In other words, there shouldn't be any blaming between different IT teams.

**‚û° Tasks:** [Understanding DevOps and Its Real-world Implication](https://github.com/techiescamp/devops-roadmap/blob/main/tasks/01-devops-research.md)

In the following sections, we will look at each tool and technology and the associated tasks to master them.

## ü§ñ Learn to use AI Tools

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT & Google Bard can engage in interactive conversations, allowing you to ask questions, seek clarification, and get immediate responses related to DevOps tools and technologies. You can use these tools for Explanation and Conceptual Understanding, Real-World Examples, Troubleshooting and Problem-solving.

With [ChatGPT plugins](https://devopscube.com/chatgpt-plugins/), you can chat with PDF content, summarize videos, and extract content from URLs, among many other features. Instead of perceiving AI tools as a threat, embrace them. By leveraging these powerful tools, you can accelerate your learning process and accomplish tasks more efficiently.

### Will AI tools replace DevOps Engineers? 

I asked this question of the tool itself, and here is what ChatGPT had to say about it.

>AI tools and automation have not replaced DevOps engineers, but rather have become an integral part of their toolkit. AI can help automate certain repetitive tasks and improve efficiency, but it doesn't remove the need for DevOps professionals. However, AI and automation tools have significantly changed the role of a DevOps engineer, reducing the time spent on routine tasks and increasing the focus on strategic, high-value work. It's important for DevOps professionals to stay current with AI and machine learning technologies as they continue to evolve.

Here is what Google bard had to say about it.

>No, AI tools will not replace DevOps engineers. AI tools can automate some of the tasks that DevOps engineers perform, but they cannot replace the human expertise and judgment that is essential for successful DevOps implementations.

## üêß Learn Linux

Lnux is #1 essential skill for any aspiring DevOps engineer.

In DevOps engineer interviews, Linux questions are often asked because Linux is the most popular operating system in the public cloud. To increase your chances of success, it's important to have a good understanding and practical experience with Linux . The commonly used Linux distributions by organizations are RHEL, Ubuntu, Cloud Specific Linux Distributions (eg: Amazon Linux). Having knowledge of these distributions shows your expertise in Linux and your ability to work effectively in the DevOps field.

## Learn about IT Infrastructure Components

To excel in a DevOps environment, it is essential to grasp the fundamental components of an organization's infrastructure, whether it resides in a cloud or an on-premise data center. Acquiring this knowledge enables effective collaboration and communication, especially when engaging with network and security teams.

Having a solid understanding of infrastructure empowers you to ask relevant questions, comprehend their responses, and enhance collaboration. Instead of simply stating, "It's not working, can you fix it?" you can contribute more effectively by saying, "I've conducted initial troubleshooting and identified some findings. Could you investigate further and help us determine the root cause of the issue?"
